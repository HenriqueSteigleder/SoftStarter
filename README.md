# SoftStarter
Using a ARM processor to make a Smoth Start in an Eletric Motor so the current DoesnÂ´t go up to Space.

We are using photo couplers to avoid direct contact of microprocessor pins with system electrical noise and we are using relays and current sensor for better motor control.

The display main purpouse is to Identify which is the mode/state of the program.


It's pretty messy but this is the physical prototype:
