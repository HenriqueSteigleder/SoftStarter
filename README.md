# SoftStarter
Using a ARM processor to make a Smoth Start in an Eletric Motor so the current DoesnÂ´t go up to Space.

We are using photo couplers to avoid direct contact of microprocessor pins with system electrical noise and we are using relays and current sensor for better motor control.

It's pretty messy but this is the physical prototype:
